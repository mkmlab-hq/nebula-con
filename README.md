# ðŸŒŒ NebulaCon - Universal Pattern Axes Discovery

## Mission
Transform fragmented internal doctrine & public research into a living semantic + forecasting layer inside BigQuery AI.

## Core Concept: 4x3 Universal Pattern Axes
- **4 Macro Axes**: Activation, Stability, Directionality, Conservation
- **3 Micro Features per Axis**: Energy/Volatility/Burstiness, Autocorr/Low-variance/Persistence, etc.

## Quickstart
\\\ash
make init          # Environment setup
make ingest        # Data ingestion
make features      # Feature engineering
make axes          # Axis extraction
make eval          # Transfer evaluation
\\\

## Roadmap
- **Week 1**: Lens refinement (4x3 axes)
- **Week 2**: Transfer validation (cross-domain)
- **Week 3**: Sensors interface (rPPG/Voice)

## Architecture
\\\
User Query â†’ Embedding â†’ Vector Search â†’ Bool Filter â†’ Answer Generation â†’ Structured Extraction

## Evaluation Metrics
- Alignment Similarity: â‰¥0.70
- Transfer Î”RMSE: â‰¥5% in â‰¥2 domains
- Axis Stability: â‰¤15Â°
